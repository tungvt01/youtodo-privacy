            <h2>3. Purchases</h2>

              method(s) in connection with any Purchase; and that (ii) the information you supply to us is true, correct

              conflict with these Terms of Service, Promotion rules will apply.</p>
            <h2>5. Subscriptions</h2>
            <p>Some parts of Service are billed on a subscription basis (“Subscription(s)”). You will be billed in
              advance on a recurring and periodic basis (“Billing Cycle”). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or
              annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.</p>
            <p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same
              conditions unless you cancel it or Tung Vu cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal
              either through your online account management page or by contacting Tung Vu customer support team.
            </p>
            <p>A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your subscription.
              You shall provide Tung Vu with accurate and complete billing information including full name,
              address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such
              payment information, you automatically authorize Tung Vu to charge all Subscription fees incurred
              through your account to any such payment instruments.</p>
            <p>Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Tung Vu will issue an electronic invoice
              indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment
              corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.</p>
            <h2>6. Free Trial</h2>
            <p>Tung Vu may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of
              time (“Free Trial”).</p>
            <p>You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for Free Trial.</p>
            <p>If you do enter your billing information when signing up for Free Trial, you will not be charged by
              Tung Vu until Free Trial has expired. On the last day of Free Trial period, unless you cancelled
              your Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of
              Subscription you have selected.</p>
            <p>At any time and without notice, Tung Vu reserves the right to (i) modify Terms of Service of Free
              Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.</p>
            <h2>7. Fee Changes</h2>
            <p>Tung Vu, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify Subscription fees for the
              Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing
              Cycle.</p>
            <p>Tung Vu will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give
              you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.</p>
            <p>Your continued use of Service after Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement
              to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.</p>
            <h2>8. Refunds</h2>
            <p>Except when required by law, paid Subscription fees are non-refundable.</p>

              WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY CLAIM FOR PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE, ARISING FROM THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY
              VIOLATION BY YOU OF ANY FEDERAL, STATE, OR LOCAL LAWS, STATUTES, RULES, OR REGULATIONS, EVEN IF COMPANY
              HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. EXCEPT AS PROHIBITED BY LAW, IF THERE IS
              LIABILITY FOUND ON THE PART OF COMPANY, IT WILL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID FOR THE PRODUCTS AND/OR
              SERVICES, AND UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL THERE BE CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES. SOME STATES DO NOT
              ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE PRIOR
              LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
            <h2>19. Termination</h2>
            <p>We may terminate or suspend your account and bar access to Service immediately, without prior notice or
              liability, under our sole discretion, for any reason whatsoever and without limitation, including but not
              limited to a breach of Terms.</p>
            <p>If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply discontinue using Service.</p>
            <p>All provisions of Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination,
              including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of
              liability.</p>
            <h2>20. Governing Law</h2>
            <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Japan without regard to its
              conflict of law provisions.</p>
            <p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those
              rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining
              provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us
              regarding our Service and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have had between us
              regarding Service.</p>
            <h2>21. Changes To Service</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right to withdraw or amend our Service, and any service or material we provide via
              Service, in our sole discretion without notice. We will not be liable if for any reason all or any part of
              Service is unavailable at any time or for any period. From time to time, we may restrict access to some
              parts of Service, or the entire Service, to users, including registered users.</p>
            <h2>22. Amendments To Terms</h2>
            <p>We may amend Terms at any time by posting the amended terms on this site. It is your responsibility to
              review these Terms periodically.</p>
            <p>Your continued use of the Platform following the posting of revised Terms means that you accept and agree
              to the changes. You are expected to check this page frequently so you are aware of any changes, as they
              are binding on you.</p>
            <p>By continuing to access or use our Service after any revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by
              the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, you are no longer authorized to use Service.</p>
            <h2>23. Waiver And Severability</h2>
            <p>No waiver by Company of any term or condition set forth in Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing
              waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of Company to
              assert a right or provision under Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
            <p>If any provision of Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,
              illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum
              extent such that the remaining provisions of Terms will continue in full force and effect.</p>
            <h2>24. Acknowledgement</h2>
            <p>BY USING SERVICE OR OTHER SERVICES PROVIDED BY US, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ THESE TERMS OF
